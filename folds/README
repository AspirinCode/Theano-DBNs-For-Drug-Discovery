To decompress my split PCBA file:
cat pcba.tar.gz.* | tar pcba.tar.gz

I have now generated all the data folds for each dataset (from Spencer's fingerprint, etc data):

PCBA: 2048 bits, & the rest [MUV, Tox21, DUD-E] are 1024 bits.

size: 4.2 gigs

file names:
<target>_actives.fl
<target>_inactives.fl

row structure (there's no header rows, & it's space delimited):
sha1_hash_id, is_active, native_cid, fold 0-4, 1024 bit string
